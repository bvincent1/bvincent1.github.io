## Chronic pain disease
I'm writing to you today because recently my girlfriend was diagnosed with a chronic pain disease. This was and continues to be a huge change in both our lives and is a constant battle for us. You might think that getting diagnosed is the hard part and that after that everything becomes easier. Unfortunately that is hardly the problem. Being diagnosed is only the first step in a long road to regain normality. Chronic pain diseases are very poorly understood and very difficult to deal with from all perspectives. They are generally handled with pain medications, which themselves have side effects that must then be treated.

In a developer sense, the body is a very complex network that we can only ever patch small pieces of. It's impossible to make a giant patch that fixes all the issues without some unforeseen consequence that requires future fixes. On top of the constant patching and fixing, the entire system slows down under the increased load, since we're only ever adding code to the process, and rarely ever removing it. This should give all the programmers a fairly good mental picture of what disease truly looks like.

Dealing with this new change has been difficult on both of us. My girlfriend has much less energy than previously and struggles with trying to keep up in her schooling (she's in nursing, so she's actually much more in tune with whats happening than me). Meanwhile, I'm struggling with trying to help her through this as well as trying to balance my own life and make sure that I'm still functioning. It's entirely possible for me to loose myself in helping her and to give little regard for myself, which causes problems in the long run. On top of this we both have to support each other mentally and emotionally with all these changes. This has certainly been the most tasking aspect of this change, and has strained our relationship.

Where all our relationships tend to operate on equality, we find that it tends to go poorly. We rarely ever consider that the imbalance is a physical one, and those are certainly the hardest kinds of imbalances.
