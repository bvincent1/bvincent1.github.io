# Interview
So tech interviews eh... They're kinda in a crazy place these days. Nobody has a perfect format yet, and everybody is trying new and cool things. Unless your not, in which case you're probably still going about it kinda wrong. Now maybe I'm wrong and you the reader are welcome to disagree with me as much as you like, but you're reading my words. So feel free to stop whenever you want, cause I'm not stopping just for your sake.

So lets take a step in a different direction. What is it like to be interviewed at a junior level? Maybe some of you have forgotten, or maybe none of you thought to ask "What would our candidates like to be asked? What kind of format do they like to be interviewed in? Why do they all seem strange and uncomfortable when we ask them simpler questions? Why can't they code for us on a whiteboard?"

Now obviously my preferences might be kinda specific, and I know I'm just a little snowflake. But I still think that I have some important feedback for interviewers out there, especially for those who interview junior level developers / engineers (like me). Obviously as we get further into our careers and gain experience things change a little, but for now lets ignore that.

# Cheat
So as a junior developer / engineer, lets look at what I've got going for me.

- not a lot of real experience
- wants  a lot of real experience
- can't seem to convince anyone the later despite the former

Great...

So here's what I am in plain text.

I'm not lazy by any means, and I'm perfectly willing to put in a lot of hard work (holds up CS degree that required a lot of hard work), but I am lazy in the sense that I won't go out of my way to make things harder and I'm only going to fulfill a feature as simply as possible (holds up CS degree that has the minimum required non-CS classes, and has the most generalized minor known to man).

*Maybe I should put optimized instead of lazy?*

So with that out of the way if your going to ask me to write a queue sorting algorithm on a whiteboard, then I highly suggest that you use google instead. I'm not going to know that, I probably will never know that, and I don't ever wan't to know that unless someone asks me to.

However if you ask me how I'd refactor a simple program to make it more functional well then just give a sec to roll up my sleeves and get cracking!

If I could recommend a list of things to talk to me about, I'd suggest starting with:
- functional programing (see above comment)
- python list or string comprehension (like seriously, how easy it is compared to JS, or god forbid C?)
- web development (http, rest, crud, etc... I love this kind of stuff!!)
- aws + linux stuff (`docker run ubuntu -i`)
- testing (I'm so bad at making tests, but I still try to get better and this would be a good way to see how I'm doing!)
- ask me about any projects I've been working on (or any of my pinned github repos)

If that's not enough, a list of things not to ask me about would include, but not be limited to:
- algorithms (You could maybe ask me about implementing (a simple) one, but don't ask me to name one)
- general code syntax (I use a lot of languages, and a lot of linters so I mix them up constantly, everything looks like Python + TS + JS + Rust)
